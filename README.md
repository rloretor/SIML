# Single instruction multiple lemmings 

This was my master's sandbox project, the project simulates collisions massively leveraging Signed Distance Fields.
In order to perform the collision detection and resolution; first a SDF is worked out of the current rendered screen using the Jump Flooding Algorithm.
Then several computation steps are taken to detect not only the shapes colliding, but also the interpenetration factors and the collision forces.
